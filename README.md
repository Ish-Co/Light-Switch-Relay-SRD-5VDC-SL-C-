# Light-Switch-Relay-SRD-5VDC-SL-C-
A mini project that lets you control home light using low voltage DC [SRD-5VDC-SL-C].

**Required Components: 
- Arduino Uno (or any other controller)
- SRD-5VDC-SL-C (or any other relay)

**wiring Diagram:
> One-way light switch that can be controlled only by the microcontroller.
